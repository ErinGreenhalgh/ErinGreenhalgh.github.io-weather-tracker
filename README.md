# Project Manager
This application is a single-page CRUD app built in order to learn React, Redux, and Firebase. Some features and functionality mimick features of [Podio's Project Management](https://podio.com/site/en) app. 

## Technologies Used:
* React (ES6) 
* Redux
* Webpack
* Firebase
* Jest & Enzyme 

## Iteration 1:
The MVP of this application builds out CRUD functionality for project with a name and a description using React in ES6. 

## Iteration 2:
The second iteration (in progress) refactors the React application to use Redux. In this iteration I plan to implement tagging and filtering functionality for projects as well. Finally, testing with Jest and Enzyme will be added. 

## Run Locally:
* clone this repository and `cd` into the `project-manager` directory 
* Install the dependencies: `npm install`
* Build static files: `npm run build` 
* Start the dev server: `npm start`
* Navigate to `localhost:8080`
